# Flappy Poop

My simplified version of Flappy Bird but with a poop emoji as the main character instead of a bird.

# Origins

This is the first program I ever made. It was made in november of 2017 when I decided to learn Java for a school project. I had often seen my sister play Flappy Bird on her phone when I was younger but by the time I had gotten an ipod the game was no longer available. I then decided I would re-create the game myself so I could play it on my laptop. After reading a Basics of Java book and watching many tutorials on youtube, this is the final product I achieved.

# Gameplay

The game normally runs at 60FPS but looks choppy in this gif to save space.
